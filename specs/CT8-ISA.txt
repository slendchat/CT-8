Processor: CT-8

=== OVERVIEW ===
* 8-bit data word size and data bus length bidirectional
* 8-bit instruction word size
* 16 bit address bus unidirectional
* endianess - Little endian
* operations are only register-register except LW and SW.

=== PLAN ===
Project: I am going to make mictoscheme of my processor in Logisim. then i am going to write EMULATOR for this thing. 
EMULATOR is going to be written in C or rust, but i dont know rust yet so maybe it is going to be my first project on rust.
Then it would be cool to write an ASSEMBLER.
All computations should perform in ALU, the design of the circuit is similar to the i4004.
